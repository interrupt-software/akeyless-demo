    <tr>
        <td><strong>Inconsistency</strong>:
            Different teams have different opinions and practices to deal with secrets materials.
        </td>
        <td>When teams have different practices, they are prone to achieve
            different outcomes with different resolutions
            to meet governance standards and industry regulations.

    <tr>
        <td><strong>Platform diversity</strong>:
            Application workflows vary depending on the target Cloud platforms,
            VMware or Kubernetes environments.

        </td>
        <td>Multiple application workflow processes across multiple target environments introduce
            significant overhead handling secrets in development, release and maintenance.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Secrets sprawl</strong>:
            Platform diversity across multiple platforms leads to an extensive collection of secrets.
        </td>
        <td>Teams that do not track their secrets centrally contribute to inconsistency,
            operational vulnerabilities and security exposures.
