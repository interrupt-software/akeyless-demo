    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Establish standardization</strong>:
            Standardize secrets orchestration to resolve the practices differences and unite teams with a shared
            solution.
        </td>
        <td> Teams are neither ahead nor behind in technology choices. An intentional
            synchronization saves time with testing cycles and minimizes edge cases that
            may undermine the overall security posture for an organization.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Process alignment</strong>:
            Establish the same process to develop, secure, validate and implement secrets orchestration
            across all Cloud platforms, VMware and Kubernetes environments.
        </td>
        <td> Teams meet the same standards for secrets creation in development, release
            and maintenance stages. Teams follow guidelines for human interaction, data format,
            network protocols, ports and secure logical paths for communication.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Strong Governance</strong>:
            With corporate guidance, teams can automate the promotion of secrets orchestration
            to support emerging standards.
        </td>
        <td> Teams can plan for emerging improvements to secrets orchestration and promote
            new rules using modern DevOps automation patterns from development, to pre-production
            and to production stages.
